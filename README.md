# About Me
Hi! My name is Andy Schachter. I was born and raised in Boston, but currently live in Portland, Maine. I kept my job in Boston, so have worked remotely for almost 4 years! Currently I am a reporting analyst for US Bank, but am looking forward to picking up some new skills and possibly switching careers.
### For Fun
* Boston sports fan
* Reading
* Playing as many sports as possible. Mainly soccer and ultimate frisbee, but with pandemic times, I have been learning to play tennis and XC ski
* Board games
* Exploring the restaurant/craft beer scene wherever I go
